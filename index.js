  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
    - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to `.play()`:

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window Binding - If 'this' is not specified, it will refer to the window.console object, or global. 

  2. Implicit Binding - Most common rule, found in 80% of use cases. When function is invoked, the left of the dot is what is refered to, ONLY applies to functions with methods.

  3. Explicit Binding - Explicitly saying what 'this' should refer to. It uses .apply, .bind, and .call. 

  4. New Binding - Uses 'new' keyword, and creates a new object that 'this' points to.
